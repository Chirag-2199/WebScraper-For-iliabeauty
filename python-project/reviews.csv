Anonymous,No,5,Love The Moisturizing Feel,"I love how this product feels on my lips. It's exactly what I'm looking for - moisturizing and with a bit of color. Unfortunately, the color I purchased, ""Runaway,” is too pink for me. Despite this, I hope to find a different shade in this product that I like. I think ""Memoir"" or “Hold Me” might be the ticket! Note: in this pic, I have on both Runaway Balm and Tahiti Gloss, both of which on their own were too pink for my liking.",1/27/25
Anonymous,No,5,Exactly What I Was Looking For,"I've been a loyal ILIA customer for some years, especially the super serum skin tint in ST7 Diaz which I wear everyday. I decided to give this balm a try because I was looking for something that's like a balm but with more color and the Lady and Heartbeats were just what I've been searching for!!! The Lady is a little more on the berry/pink side so I could wear it all the time. The Heartbeat I wear when I need a little bit more red, and sometimes I add a red gloss over it. I just love them! Highly recommend!!!",1/2/25
Anonymous,No,5,So Hydrating With Beautiful Color,My lips get horribly dry each season. I have been using these balms and have them in three different colors. With a lip liner they are long lasting and leave your lips hydrated with a beautiful color. They are highly pigmented or if you tap with a piece of toilette paper you can reduce the pigment.,11/21/24
Anonymous,No,5,Moisturizing And Beautiful Color,This balm is my lips but better. It’s moisturizing and gives just enough color. I am wearing Runaway. Love that it is more natural.,10/18/24
Anonymous,No,5,Perfect Lipstick For The Desert,"I live in the high desert and don't drink water so my lips are always chapped. This has become my favorite lip tool that gives enough coverage to be a lipstick and actually hydrates my lips! I will keep buying this, I only wish there were even more color options.",9/27/24
